# Flame-buzz-sensor
This project uses an Arduino with an IR receiver and a temperature sensor (thermistor ) to detect flames and high temperatures. The IR receiver detects infrared light from flames, while the temperature sensor measures heat levels. When the temperature exceeds a preset threshold, a buzzer is triggered.
